# Reactive Hook Plugins

A sophisticated, upgradeable smart contract system that implements reactive components for DeFi hooks using the Beacon Proxy pattern and reactive callback compliance.


## Set Up


clone the repo and run 
```sh
make test-failure
```

## 🎯 Overview

The Reactive Hook Plugins system enables the creation of modular, upgradeable components that can be dynamically attached to DeFi hooks. Each component is reactive-callback compliant and can be upgraded independently, providing a flexible architecture for complex DeFi operations.

## ✨ Features

- **Beacon Proxy Architecture**: Centralized upgrade management through a beacon contract
- **Reactive Components**: Each component implements reactive callback compliance
- **Dynamic Extension System**: Deploy and upgrade hook extensions on-demand
- **ERC165 Compliance**: Standard interface detection and compatibility
- **On-Chain Metrics**: Fully on-chain calculation of trading volume, APR, and LP metrics
- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized for minimal gas consumption during operations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ReactiveHookBeacon**: The central beacon contract that manages all hook extensions
2. **HookExtension**: Base contract for all reactive components
3. **ReactiveCallback**: Interface for reactive callback compliance
4. **ExtensionRegistry**: Registry for managing deployed extensions

### Design Patterns

- **Beacon Proxy Pattern**: Enables centralized upgrade management
- **Reactive Callback Pattern**: Ensures components respond to state changes
- **Extension Factory Pattern**: Streamlines extension deployment

## 🚀 Use Cases

### Trading Volume Metrics
- Track real-time trading volume for liquidity pools
- Calculate historical volume trends
- Provide volume-based fee adjustments

### APR Calculation
- On-chain APR computation without off-chain dependencies
- Real-time yield optimization
- Dynamic fee structure based on performance

### LP Metrics
- Liquidity provider performance tracking
- Impermanent loss calculations
- Risk assessment metrics

### Custom Extensions
- Arbitrage opportunity detection
- MEV protection mechanisms
- Cross-protocol integration bridges
