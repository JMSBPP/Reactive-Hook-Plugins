##  Problem Description

AMMs were designed to democratize liquidity provision, but the current AMM design creates a **fundamental inefficiency** in liquidity provision where sophisticated participants systematically outcompete retail participants [1][2][3]

This problem manifests through JIT liquidity concentration in high-value pools, extracting disproportionate fees and creating crowding out effects [1][3]. Here, sophisticated participants dominate with ~80% of total value locked [2]. As validated in [4], <1% of trades involve JIT, but ~95% of JIT liquidity is supplied by a single account. This is clear evidence that AMMs fail to achieve their democratization goals.


## Solution Overview

The ParityTax-AMM system addresses the fundamental inefficiencies in AMM liquidity provision through a **sophisticated fiscal policy framework** that enables equitable fee distribution between JIT (Just-in-Time) and PLP (Passive Liquidity Provider) participants. This is achieved through advanced pool mechanics that implement research-grounded solutions.

### Core Solution Architecture

#### 1. **Two-Tiered Fee Structure** [1]
- **JIT Taxation**: JIT LPs share a portion of their fee revenue with PLPs [1]
- **Concentration-Based Rates**: Developers can implement higher tax rates when JIT concentration exceeds thresholds [1]
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Developers can implement real-time tax rate optimization based on market conditions in response to Hook events [1]

```solidity
// Fee transfer mechanism: JIT LP Fee Share = Î» Ã— (Pro-rata Fee Share)
// Passive LP Fee Share = (1-Î») Ã— (JIT LP Pro-rata Share) + (Direct Pro-rata Share)
```

#### 2. **Commitment-Based Reward System** [3]
- **Time-Weighted Rewards**: PLPs receive increasing rewards based on commitment duration [3]
- **Credit Accrual**: Developers can implement sophisticated reward distribution based on contribution and commitment [3]

#### 3. **Governance Integration** [1][3]
- **Pool-Specific Parameters**: Custom fiscal policies for different pool types [1]
- **Democratic Control**: Community governance over policy parameters and upgrades [1]

### Enabling Technologies

#### **Real-Time Event Processing** [1][3]
- **Reactive Network Architecture**: Event-driven system for dynamic parameter adjustment [1]
- **Transient Storage**: Efficient parameter storage enabling complex optimization without blocking transactions [1]

#### **Upgradable Fiscal Policy Interface**
Developers can design and upgrade their own allocation rules through two core functions:

```solidity
// Primary customization points for developers
function accrueCredit(PoolId poolId, bytes memory data) external returns(uint256, uint256);
function calculateOptimalTax(PoolId poolId, bytes memory data) external returns(uint24);
```

### Classical Fiscal Policy Parallel

The system intentionally links AMM theory with traditional economic principles to ease the learning curve and enable faster development by solving dual problems using well-known economic concepts like optimal taxation.

#### **Government Fiscal Policy Analogy**
Similar to traditional government fiscal policy:
- **Tax Collection**: JIT LPs pay taxes on their fee revenue
- **Revenue Allocation**: Tax revenue is allocated to PLPs through credit accrual
- **Policy Customization**: Different pool deployers implement different fiscal policies
- **Governance**: Policy parameters set through `beforeInitialize` governance

### Benefits

#### **For Liquidity Providers**
- **Equitable Fee Distribution**: PLPs receive fair compensation for their commitment [1][3]
- **Reduced Competition**: Commitment mechanisms reduce excessive competition [3]
- **Predictable Rewards**: Clear reward structure based on contribution and commitment [3]

#### **For Pool Deployers**
- **Customizable Policies**: Design fiscal policies tailored to specific pool characteristics [1][3]
- **Governance Control**: Democratic control over policy parameters and upgrades [1][3]
- **Performance Optimization**: Real-time parameter adjustment for optimal outcomes [1][3]

#### **For the Ecosystem**
- **Market Efficiency**: Improved overall liquidity provision and market depth [1][3]
- **Democratization**: Reduced barriers to entry for retail liquidity providers [2][3]
- **Research Integration**: Implementation of cutting-edge academic research in practice [1][2][3][4]

#### **For Developers**
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between core functionality and policy implementation
- **Gas Optimized**: Transient storage and efficient algorithms minimize gas costs
- **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive templates and documentation for policy development
- **Governance Ready**: Built-in governance mechanisms for democratic control
- **Upgradeable**: UUPS pattern allows policy evolution without migration

This solution represents a fundamental advancement in AMM design, successfully bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation to create a more equitable, efficient, and customizable liquidity provision system.
