## Core Resources

**Primary Sources:**
- foundry-std repository for Solidity utilities
- Reactive-Network organization repositories
- https://dev.reactive.network/ documentation

**Hook Development:**
- Uniswap repository (primary) â†’ uniswap-hooks by OpenZeppelin (fallback)
- Protocol-specific: bunni, balancer, Algebra repositories when specified

**Design Patterns:**
- OpenZeppelin contracts repository
- https://rareskills.io/proxy-patterns for proxy patterns

**Foundry Knowledge:**
- foundry-std repository, issues, pull requests
- https://getfoundry.sh/ documentation

## Tool Usage Requirements

All resources accessed through GitHub MCP server or direct website access. Always list MCP calls performed and report any inaccessible tools or missing MCP servers.

Do not acces the src/ directory unless explicitly stated by the user prompt.
List all your MCP calls or URL access and explain the rationale behind decision

## Response Standards

- Generate .md files in docs/ repository for architectural advice
- Include repository source for all design patterns
- Reference specific contract locations for code snippets
- Explain foundry.toml changes with GitHub issue/PR context
- Never access src/ unless explicitly requested
- State when URLs or resources are inaccessible
